kinds of money. If you could bring any credit card (yours or from your parents). Sometimes the bureaucracy in scholarships can make the process delayed. Don´t count only in the CSF
money, and if you are going to make a VTM, make it in agencies like CONFIDENCE. I made it in Bradesco and they charge R$50 just for each recharge (no makes sense, I know) and in Confidence it´s charged R$3 in each recharge and you can register 2 peoplein Brasil to make the reload.';

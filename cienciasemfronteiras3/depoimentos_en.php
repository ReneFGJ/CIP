//<BR>Minhas orientadoras são bem queridas e me ajudam bastante. Estou mandando uam foto com elas. Nela estou com a Prof. Ms. Pawelzik e uma estudante de douturado (Manuela Fitz) com a qual eu trabalhei semestre passado em um projeto sobre a qualidade do trigo. 
//Neste dia, aconteceu uma festa no laboratorio em homenagem a outro estudante que havia terminado o seu doutorado. A professora Pawelzik e o marido me mostraram as fotos de quando estiveram em Curitiba ano passado. Fotos da PUCPR, da fazenda, dos passeios que eles fizeram... 
//Fiquem bem feliz enquanto eles me contavam o que viram e fizeram no Brasil.
//<BR>Terminei meu subprojeto com a Manuela no começo de agosto, estamos planejando uma apresentacao com os meus resultados. Semana que vem comecarei um novo subprojeto com outro estudante de doutorado, também sobre a qualidade do trigo. 
//Estaremos comparando o trigo armazenado em silos com pesticidas e em silos com a temperatura controlada. Estou bem animada para recomecar.';

$texto = '"I believe that doesn´t matter where I am going, if I am going to live by myself and moving out from my house to live without my parents it is a big learning. It was the first time that I really
had to muddle through by myself, and I confess in the beggining I made some mistakes, but as
time goes by it becomes more rare and now, after more than six months away from Brazil, I realize how much I´ve grown up with all I´ve learned here.
Germany is an incredible place, with all the background stories, the food, people I get surprised with everything. They say germans are cold and boring, and some of them really are, but there is this kind of people everywhere. Doesn´t matter where you are, most of them are very cool, able to help you whenever you need. There is no problem if you don´t speak german very well: people know how to speak English and just those ones who have difficulties with this language that gets angry when they´re helping you. But it doesn´t mean they won´t help you. 
My program is being oriented to laboratory projects, and I had the opportunity to attend just to two
subjects, which won´t count in my undergraduation when I come back to Brazil, because I am  immersed here in another degree course. However a paper reward is nothing compared to what I am learning, not only in academic discussions, but in personal life. I recommend Germany, in fact, I would recommend anywhere, because it is a unique experience in exchange and this chance can´t be wasted."';

$texto = '"God created the world, and the dutchmen created Netherlands." - and I add that them made a good job. Everywhere it is noticed the concerning about life quality, since the concerts on tv and fresh air cinemas to an extensive commom carrier covering all the city and country. Living under the level sea (some placesm more than 10 meters bellow) it is not reason to dutchman living ashamed - on contrary, they are welcoming and they don´t wast time in parting, doesn´t matter with who neither where. As a matter of fact, the campus and the city are rich in foreign students: sérvio, iranian, colombian, chinese, canadian, french...
<BR>Who choose coming to here, I have some tips. Pay attention to the of getting the residence and
entrance visa, even if without mistakes in documents, the process can be delayed and you can
lost some classes trying to solve this. Try to find a place to live before you arrive in the country - it saves a lot of time. Finally, buy the ov-chipkaart as soon as possible, because you can travel over all the Netherlands by train, subway, buses, and the taxes get chipper.
<BR>Netherlands is a incredible country, and it goes beyond the coffee shops and the Red Light District. Coming over here it is a unique experience and living here in unforgettable.';

$texto = 'I´ve always had the american image wanted to be the best of all (and in fact some of them think
like this), but when you tell them you are from Brazil, it´s different. They want to know about soccer, about our food and about how much we are kind and happy. Nowadays, to be brazilian is a reason of being proud. After saying your name, never forget to tell you are from Brazil. I did this and I realized that chatting becomes more relaxed. In the early days I was impressed with  everything, because here most of things are exaggerated. Looks like everything comes from Itú... hehehehe... The college buildings seems like castles, and the "small size" glasses in american fast-food are the "extra-large" ones in Brazil. The large ones can feed a family in Brasil. You will find queer a lot the food, and seriously, who likes beans, rice and steak for lunch will find strange in the first days but you will get used to it. Coffee, how I miss our brazilian coffee, with a  cheese-bread"... yumyyy... but we have to follow the flow, and I am here and need to get used to it. You will be shocked with how we are a exploitatived and you feel even so happy in the same time with the cars, eletronics and shoes that seems always for sale, because the taxes aren´t that expensive like Brazil´s one! whoops, I think the rest you have to figure out by yourself. Good luck in this new time of your lives. It will be a experience to remember throught all your life.';

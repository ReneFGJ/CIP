There is a model in facebook´s group, if anybody needs I can foward it by email. It is useful to bring a case with basic medicines, like medicine for headache, muscular pain, colic, stomachache, antiacid.

				 			<p>Try to bring few clothes, and the winter ones you should buy here (at least who is coming to north hemisfere now in september), because there is old collections in very chip prices. I bought a coat by $30, and in Brazil I would not take it for less than R$400... =)

				 			<span class="lt10">MONEY</span>
				 			<p>I came just with my VTM (Visa Travel Money) and my university account card, because when I arrived here, I should open an USA bank account. My advise is that you should bring one or more kinds of money. If you could bring any credit card (yours or from your parents). Sometimes the bureaucracy in scholarships can make the process delayed. Don´t count only in the CSF money, and if you are going to make a VTM, make it in agencies like CONFIDENCE. I made it in Bradesco and they charge R$50 just for each recharge (no makes sense, I know) and in Confidence it´s charged R$3 in each recharge and you can register 2 peoplein Brasil to make the reload.

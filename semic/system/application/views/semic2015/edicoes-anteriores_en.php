				<p>
					The news on this edition is the Initiation Seminar in Technological and Innovation Development (PIBITI) with 54 researches. Added to these, we have more 461 researches from PIBIC and 218 researches from master and doctorate degree from different post-graduation strict sensu programs from PUCPR, summing up 679 researches presented during the event. This is, with no doubt, the correct environment to discuss new ideas, to share the results and yet, a place for young researchers to receive the feedback from experienced researchers that act as evaluators. Every year, PUCPR awards the best work, giving the opportunity to PIBIC students to participate on the Annual Reunion from Brazilian Society to the Science Progress (SBPC) for the presentation of their researches.

					The biggest objective from Scientific Initiation Programs - PIBIC and PIBIC Jr – is the formation of human resources by the learning and development of the research activities by the orientation of a researcher professor. The Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná has given a special attention to the young researcher formation and it already has a long tradition on the Scientific Initiation, participating on the PIBIC for 18 years and on the PIBIC Jr for 3 years. Besides that, it is the only IES that offers the PIBIC Jr to private schools as a counterpart to the received scholarship from CNPq.

					The Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná has on the Scientific Initiation a solid contribution to the human being formation in all the dimensions, not only on the intellectual ones. This way, as a result of the institutional priorization, PIBIC has been consolidated and expanded, this year we have the first edition of the Junior Research Seminar, with the participation of high school students from private and public schools. The XV Scientific Initiation Seminar and the IX PUCPR Research Show are demonstrations of scientific maturity from PUCPR, which has 12 master degree courses stricto sensu and 7 doctorates, involving all the knowledge areas.

				<p>
					The model of the governmental support to the Scientific Initiation, through the Scholarship Institutional Program in Scientific Initiation (PIBIC), created by CNPq, is a case of success on the young instrumentalization to participate on the knowledge generation. Through the student?s interaction with his/her advisor, the undergraduate student has the opportunity to know and apply the scientific method to his/her knowledge area. As a result, there is a process of educational emancipation to the citizenship, while he interacts with the process authors (professors, post-graduate students and technical) and with the research object, creating abilities like logical thought, initiative, conflicts solve and determination.

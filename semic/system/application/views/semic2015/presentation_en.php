	<h2><strong>Scientific and Technological Initiation</strong></h2>
	<p align="justify">
		The Scientific and Technological Initiation at PUCPR is a strategic activity in the formation of critical students, creative and connected with the environment and globally searching solutions that can contribute to a better society.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		This event is the occasion in which students present the results of their research developed over 12 months, so it is a time for celebrating the performed route. It is also a concrete show that PUCPR provides to the students, each of them treading their individual pathway supported in a network of experienced researchers.
	</p>
	
	<p align="justify">
		Neste ano, esta rede se amplia extra-muros entre os estudantes, pois estarão conosco 7 bolsistas CNPq do programa PIBITI do SENAI, que farão a apresentação dos resultados de suas pesquisas durante o evento. 
	</p>
	
	
	<p align="justify">
		It will be three days of intense scientific debates, lectures, round tables, mini-course, poster sessions, prototypes exhibition of innovative projects, cultural and artistic performances. And much more: the opportunity to establish network with 2,000 students (high school, undergraduate and international students), all interested in research; 500 researchers who acted as research advisors, as well as 200 evaluators.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		Surely this space will be a flurry of new ideas, with the energy of youth committed to "A + HUMAN world through research"!
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		I wish you all moments of achievement and success.
	</p>

		Best regards,

	<h1>CONCEPT</h1>
	<p align="justify">
		PUCPR recently set some strategic areas that are aligned with global challenges, with internal skills, with planning and institutional mission, namely: Human Rights Cities, Energy, Biotechnology, Health, Communication Technology and Information.
	</p>
	<p align="left">

		</center>
	</p>
	<br />
	<p align="justify">
		To spread this position of the University among the university community itself and contribute to the further development of emerging issues at each strategic area, it was decided that each year SEMIC will take one of them as the central theme.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		This year, Human Rights topic is in focus: PUCPR believes that the university should position itself as a permanent space for debate on human rights. The proposal is to strengthen the democratic mechanisms in defense and monitoring of human rights violations and propose alternatives for mediation and conflict resolution in Brazil and Latin America.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		The area has as priorities the social education on human rights and the articulation of a broad network, formed by academics, teachers, government agencies, organizations and social movements to develop interdisciplinary researches.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		 We invite all young researchers to engage in this way, taking part in the debates proposed around the following themes: forced migration, violence, childhood and youth, among others.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
		The event will finish with a discussion of the interface between Human Rights and Cities an early discussion on "a new sustainable urban project that can reconnect people with their living space, not forgetting to seek the emergency solutions to the current crisis." Cities will be our challenge for the 2016 event!
